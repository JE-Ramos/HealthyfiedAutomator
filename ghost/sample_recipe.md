## Ingredients

- 0.25 tsp ground pepper
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp fresh thyme
- 15 g unsalted butter
- 150 g tomatoes
- 190 g fresh string beans
- 2 tbsp coconut amino
- 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 218 g young corn, cut
- 3 large eggs
- 300 g eggplant, raw
- 40 g red onion
- 420 g boneless milkfish (bangus)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 175°C (350°F). This will ensure the oven is at the right temperature for baking the fish.

2. Place the boneless milkfish on a clean surface. Sprinkle and rub with coconut amino, garlic powder, thyme, and ground pepper on both sides.

3. Cut the eggplant, tomatoes, and red onion into thin slices (about 0.5 cm thick). Cut the young corn into small, bite-sized pieces.

4. Take a baking dish and place the seasoned milkfish in the center. Arrange the sliced vegetables (eggplant, tomatoes, young corn, and red onion) around the fish. Pour the extra virgin olive oil evenly over everything.

5. Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 25 minutes. The fish is done when it flakes easily with a fork and appears opaque white throughout.

6. While the fish is baking, clean the string beans by removing their ends. Cut them into pieces of about 5 cm (2 inches) in length.

7. Place a skillet (frying pan) over medium heat. Add the butter and let it melt completely. Add the string beans and cook for 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they become soft enough to easily pierce with a fork.

8. Crack the eggs into a bowl and beat them with a fork or whisk until the whites and yolks are fully combined. Add a small pinch of salt and pepper. Pour the eggs into the same skillet used for the string beans. Stir gently until the eggs solidify completely (about 2-3 minutes). Remove from heat.

9. Take the baked fish and vegetables out of the oven. Serve hot with the string beans and scrambled eggs on the side.
